## My Approach
Due to time constraints, I only had 1.5 days to complete the application. As such, before starting, I had to pick my priorities and what I wanted to focus on. Ultimately, I decided my focus would be on the following key issues:

1) Writing logic for application in clean code
2) Making application as interactive as possible
