## My Approach
Due to time constraints, I only had 1.5 days to complete the application. As such, before starting, I had to pick my priorities and what I wanted to focus on. Ultimately, I decided my focus would be on the following key issues:

1. Writing logic for application in clean code
2. Making application as interactive as possible



## Reflections

Since the backend was fairly straightforward, I was able to devote a lot more time to the frontend. This was an interesting change to what I normally do and I enjoyed fiddling with things a lot more than I thought and probably spent WAY too much time on styling my buttons.

Lack of timing was an issue and put constraints on things I wanted to do. I had to scrap the initial goal of deploying it with Node.js on Heroku as configuring NPM and Node on my old Windows laptop (having returned my Mac to Makers) and setting up the project would have taken some time which I wanted to spend on making the puzzle more interactive.


## What Next?
* Deploy to server with Node.js.
* Save high scores (timings) to database so player can assess their timings against other players.
* Sound effects!
